## Context

Before an event occurs, an event organiser needs to have a list of all the participants who are taking part in their event and which race they are running in . This list is called a ‘race startlist’.

When someone makes a booking through our site, we need to collect all their relevant information and display it to our event organisers in a clear, easy to read format.

## Specification

You have been asked to build a dashboard that makes it easy for for organisers to view race startlist entries and ticket sale revenue.

1. It must be possible for organisers to apply a filter so that they can see only their startlist entries.
2. It must also be possible for each organiser to see how much they have made in ticket sales.
